# Ureckathon-2023 @UEM Kolkata - Track: Health Technology

## Project Name - Health & Fitness Monitoring Application
## Problem Statement - In today's fast-paced world, people are increasingly becoming conscious about their health and fitness. However, many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to a lack of knowledge and resources. With the rise of sedentary jobs and easy access to unhealthy food, it has become more important than ever to have a reliable and accessible platform to track your body mass index (BMI), nutritional intake, and exercise routine. 

## Proposed Solution - Our innovative online platform aims to provide a one-stop solution for all your health and wellness needs. By leveraging the power of technology and data, we empower users to take control of their health by providing easy-to-use tools and resources to track their progress and achieve their fitness goals. Our app is designed to be accessible to everyone, from fitness enthusiasts to those just starting their wellness journey. With our comprehensive approach to health tracking, users can achieve long-term success and lead a happier, healthier life.

## Project Description - This website mainly deals with calculating the Body Mass Index(BMI) of the user by taking input their weight(Kg) & height(m).BMI is a very important health parameter that depicts whether the person is healthy or obese or in between. Following that this website provides user with a nutrient composition page where users can put in their desired food product and obtain certain important nutritional constituents which can be beneficial for their dietary planning(Pretty much what is most required for a healthy lifestyle and a controlled BMI). Moreover there is also an Exercise Guide page where users can input their desired muscle group they need to train and the server will provide them with the most effective forms of workout plans along with detailed instructions in order to successfully perform the exercises. Thus this project deals with 3 important monitoring methods of health and well being which are connected to each other and needs to be monitored at a regular basis.
